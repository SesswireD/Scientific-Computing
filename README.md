Content for the UVA Master Course 'Scientific Computing'

Assignment 1: 
* SCAs1Wave: contains code for the simulation of the 1D wave equation
* SCAs1Diffusion: contains code for the simulation of the 2D diffusion equation (both time-dependent and time-independent)

Assigment 2:
* SCAs2DLA: contains code for the simulation of Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) using the Successive Over Relaxation Solver from SCAs2Diffusion.
* SCAs2MC: contains code for the simulation of DLA using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of random walkers.
* SCAs2RD: contains code for the simulation of Reaction Diffusion using the equations from Gray-Scott.
